# Multi-Threaded-Client-Server-System
This project was developed for a distributed systemâ€™s course, involving 3 clients and a server running locally on multiple threads handling incoming and outgoing requests. Client could create,delete,rename,copy files in the server by using an Interactive GUI. Client can automatically see changes being updated at the server end if any changes are done to folders currently at the Client's end.
